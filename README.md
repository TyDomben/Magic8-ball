Weighted Magic 8 Ball Function
Overview
The Weighted Magic 8 Ball is a JavaScript function that mimics the behavior of a classic Magic 8 Ball toy, with a twist. Instead of each response having an equal chance of being selected, this function allows you to assign different probabilities (weights) to each possible outcome. This makes some responses more likely than others, adding an interesting dynamic to the decision-making process.

Features
Weighted Responses: Customize the likelihood of each response.
Easy to Modify: Add or remove responses and their weights as needed.
Random Selection: Responses are selected randomly, respecting their assigned weights.
Setup
To use the Weighted Magic 8 Ball function, you need to have a JavaScript environment set up. This can be in a browser console, an HTML file, or a Node.js environment.

Browser Console:

Open your web browser.
Right-click and select "Inspect" or "Developer Tools".
Navigate to the "Console" tab.
Copy and paste the function code here.
HTML File:

Create an HTML file.
Include a <script> tag and paste the function code inside it.
Node.js Environment:

Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
Create a .js file and paste the function code.
Run the file using Node.js.
Usage
To use the function, simply call weightedMagic8Ball().

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(weightedMagic8Ball());
This will output a randomly selected response based on the defined weights.

Customization
To customize the responses and their weights:

Modify the responses array.
Add or remove objects, ensuring each has an answer (string) and a weight (number).
Adjust the weights to control the probability of each response.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
const responses = [
    { answer: "Yes, definitely.", weight: 10 },
    { answer: "No, not likely.", weight: 5 },
    // Add more responses here
];
